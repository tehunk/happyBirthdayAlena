## Hello Alena,

It’s Tae :)

First of all,

* **HAPPY BIRTHDAY !**
* **생일 축하해 !**
* **з Днем народження !**

It’s near the end of 2019, and you have reached another year of your life. Exciting! It has been wonderful to know you and be friend of yours for many years. I wish you the best of the best today, and I hope you have enough time to spend with your friends and family :) I’ll be there in spirit from Berlin. Don’t forget to take care of yourself as you are feeling sick!

My apology that I didn’t have time to send you a letter and a gift in advance because I kept traveling all over Asia and Europe the past two weeks. So... I decided to make a website to celebrate your birthday. This website is dedicated to you Alena. Well, I’ll still send you a real gift, so wait for it.

This website will expire in one year. If we still keep in touch next year, I will probably recycle this website to send you another wish :) Until then, you can visit here whenever you want.

Have the best day!

Yours best,

Tae on Wed. Nov 13, 2019
