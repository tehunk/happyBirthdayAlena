## Happy Birthday in 2020

Happy birthday !!!

This year has been crazy due to the coronavirus. I suppose we all had a turbulent year.
The pandemic took many lives, and subsequent lockdowns/quarantines made people stay home including me.
For me, it was time to think about my relationships with others such as my family and friends.
Of course, they were always important, but it was rather easy to overlook their importance when I was busier with work.
I feel grateful for those who stay with me and care about me even in such a difficult time.
And for that, I also thank you for always being a good friend. I really appreciate it.
I wish to have a chance to travel and visit you in the near future... I really want to travel!

Have another wonderful year of your life :)

Yours truly,

Tae

## Hello Alena,

It’s Tae :)

First of all,

* **HAPPY BIRTHDAY!**
* **생일 축하해!**
* **з Днем народження!**

It’s near the end of 2019, and you have reached another year of your life. Exciting! It has been wonderful to know you and to be a friend of yours for many years. I wish you the best of the best today, and I hope you have enough time to spend with your friends and family :) I’ll be there in spirit from Berlin. Don’t forget to take care of yourself as you are feeling sick!

My apologies that I didn’t have time to send you a letter and a gift in advance because I kept traveling all over Asia and Europe for the past two weeks. So… I decided to make a website to celebrate your birthday. This website is dedicated to you, Alena. Well, I’ll still send you a real gift, so wait for it.

This website will expire in one year. If we still keep in touch next year, I will probably recycle this website to send you another wish :) Until then, you can visit here whenever you want.

Have the best day!

Yours best,

Tae on Wed. Nov 13, 2019
